# a-star-draw
Small little project that uses the A* algorithm to pathfind through a maze created by a given image. Created using the [processing library](https://processing.org)
and vanilla Java. Image source can be modified by changing a part of the code in the `processImage()` method of the `Renderer` class.

## Keybinds
- r -> resets the pathfinder
- i -> resets the image used/maze
- f -> shows performance metrics
- UP/DOWN arrow -> changes the frame rate cap
